    <h4>Q2:- Create an HTML document with appropriate title> and meta>tag for SEO optimization.Ensure the title is descriptive and the meta description is concise?</h4>


    <Ans:->A meta description is an HTML element that provides a brief summary of a web page. A page’s meta description tag is displayed as part of the search snippet in a search engine results page (SERP) and is meant to give the user an idea of the content that exists within the page and how it relates to their search query.</Ans:->

 <!-- Example -->
    <!-- <head>
        <meta name="description" content="This is an example of a
        meta description. This will often show up in search results.">
        </head> -->
        <!-- You can find your page’s meta description within the <head> section of the page’s HTML markup. -->


            <p>This is the HTML title tag, also called the SEO title. When you look something up in a search engine, you get a list of results that appear as snippets. The part that looks like a headline is the SEO title. The SEO title usually contains the post title but can include other elements, such as the site name. Or even emojis!</p>
